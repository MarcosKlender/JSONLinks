Here you have the expectations to submit your projects.

## What we expect

We expect all projects to make use of a JSON file to edit the content of the website you developed.
In order to keep this website simple and reduce maintenance costs, we ask that you upload your projects to your own GitHub repository highlighting the following aspects:

### Show your JSON
You need to provide JSON that your project is going to use and, if necessary, explain its structure.

Example:

*Attach example of my JSON.

### Front-End

We ask you to provide the tool that, making use of your JSON, will allow us to build your project. Feel free to use the framework or technology you are most comfortable with.

### ReadMe

We consider the explanation about how your project works is vital for the correct use of it. Please be as specific as you can. You can use this template as a baseline:

*Markdown template.

Example:

*Attach link to my project's Readme.
