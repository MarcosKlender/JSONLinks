Welcome to this Open Source Initiative where you will find JSON based links pages.

## Main purpose

Our goal is to be a useful repository for all developers looking to create projects in a simple way without cost. Let's prove that in open source community we always support each other. 

## Why JSON?

We are confident that the JSON format is here to stay. It's lightweight, easy to manipulate and perfect for building efficient websites.

Believe me when I tell you that if you combine a JSON file and the framework of your choice you can build practically anything. Your imagination is the limit. 

## First Project

The first project we are launching with this site is an alternative to the famous Linktree. Why did I do it? To avoid using those "free" platforms and give them more visibility in our local market.

This is the initial idea, to be able to create really free alternatives, easy to adapt to our needs and that allow us to demonstrate our own capabilities. 

## How to contribute?

We encourage everyone to contribute with your own ideas, projects and solutions. All recommendations and suggestions are welcome. From small visual changes and bug fixes to large ready-to-use projects, all contributions are welcome.

For developers, by developers.
